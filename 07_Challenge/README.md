# Model Training Challenge! 

In these notebooks, there are a whole host of weird errors. 
Some of them will be obvious and throw an error, but some are less clear and will break things without telling you they're breaking. 
Do your best to sniff out the mistakes in both code and training proceedure! 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is: 
* Work together in groups of 4 to complete this notebook
* Figure out all the coding mistakes and make a notebook that runs
* Find the mistakes in training and take apporiate corrective measures so the model trains well!
* Do not change the data generator or plotting code, marked with #'s

* If you cannot correct the problem, identify it and write a quick paragraph about what you would do
* You are allowed to use any resource you can find; other groups, TA's, a random scientist walking back, and most importantly, the internet.
